**Let's break down the entire code into chunks and explain each part:**

### Import Statements
```java
import java.util.*;
```
- This line includes the necessary Java utility package for using `Scanner` and `ArrayList`.

### Solution Class
```java
class Solution {
    // Methods for merge sort
    private static void merge(int[] arr, int low, int mid, int high) {
        // ... (explained below)
    }

    public static void mergeSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        // ... (explained below)
    }
}
```
- `Solution` is a class that contains methods for implementing the merge sort algorithm.

### `merge` Method
```java
private static void merge(int[] arr, int low, int mid, int high) {
    // ... (explained below)
}
```
- This method performs the merging step of the merge sort algorithm.

### `merge` Method Explanation
```java
ArrayList<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
int left = low;
int right = mid + 1;

while (left <= mid && right <= high) {
    if (arr[left] <= arr[right]) {
        temp.add(arr[left]);
        left++;
    } else {
        temp.add(arr[right]);
        right++;
    }
}

while (left <= mid) {
    temp.add(arr[left]);
    left++;
}

while (right <= high) {
    temp.add(arr[right]);
    right++;
}

for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
    arr[i] = temp.get(i - low);
}
```
- This part of the `merge` method performs the actual merging of two sorted halves.
- It uses a temporary `ArrayList` (`temp`) to store the merged elements in a sorted manner.
- The `while` loops compare elements from the left and right halves and add the smaller element to `temp`.
- The remaining elements from either half are added to `temp`.
- The final `for` loop transfers the elements from `temp` back to the original array `arr`.

### `mergeSort` Method
```java
public static void mergeSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
    if (low >= high) return;
    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
    mergeSort(arr, low, mid);
    mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, high);
    merge(arr, low, mid, high);
}
```
- This method is a recursive implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
- It recursively divides the array into halves until the base case is reached (one element or no elements).
- It then merges the sorted halves using the `merge` method.

### `tUf` Class (Main Class)
```java
public class tUf {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // ... (explained below)
    }
}
```

### Main Method Explanation
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = 7;
int arr[] = { 9, 4, 7, 6, 3, 1, 5 };

System.out.println("Before sorting array: ");
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
}
System.out.println();

Solution.mergeSort(arr, 0, n - 1);

System.out.println("After sorting array: ");
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
}
System.out.println();
```
- This part of the code is the main method.
- It initializes an array (`arr`) and prints it before sorting.
- It then calls the `mergeSort` method to sort the array using the merge sort algorithm.
- Finally, it prints the sorted array.

### Summary
- The code implements the merge sort algorithm in Java.
- The `Solution` class contains methods for merging (`merge`) and sorting (`mergeSort`).
- The `tUf` class is the main class that initializes an array, sorts it using merge sort, and prints the before and after arrays.

The merge sort algorithm divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array. The `ArrayList` is used for temporary storage during the merging process.

**Let's break down the for loop in the `merge` method:**

```java
for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
    arr[i] = temp.get(i - low);
}
```

This for loop is responsible for transferring elements from the temporary array (`temp`) back to the original array (`arr`). Here's how it works:

1. `low` is the starting index of the subarray being merged.
2. `high` is the ending index of the subarray being merged.
3. The loop iterates from `low` to `high`, inclusive, which means it processes each index in the subarray.

Inside the loop:

- `i` is the index in the original array `arr`.
- `temp.get(i - low)` retrieves the element from the temporary array at the corresponding position.

Here's an example to illustrate the process:

Suppose we have a subarray `[2, 4, 6]` starting at index `low = 1` and ending at index `high = 3`. The temporary array `temp` contains the sorted version of this subarray.

1. When `i = 1`, `temp.get(i - low)` corresponds to `temp.get(0)`, which is the first element of the sorted subarray (`2` in this case). This element is assigned to `arr[1]`.
2. When `i = 2`, `temp.get(i - low)` corresponds to `temp.get(1)`, which is the second element of the sorted subarray (`4` in this case). This element is assigned to `arr[2]`.
3. When `i = 3`, `temp.get(i - low)` corresponds to `temp.get(2)`, which is the third element of the sorted subarray (`6` in this case). This element is assigned to `arr[3]`.

This process continues until all elements from the temporary array have been transferred back to the original array, and the subarray is now sorted in the original array.

Essentially, this loop ensures that the elements in the original array are replaced with the sorted elements from the temporary array during the merging step of the merge sort algorithm.

In Java, arrays are objects, and when you pass an array to a method, you are passing a reference to the array. This means that any changes made to the array within the method will affect the original array outside the method. In the case of `mergeSort`, it sorts the original array in place, so the changes made within `mergeSort` will be reflected in the `arr` array declared in the `main` method.

Here's a breakdown of what happens:

1. `mergeSort` is called with the array `arr` and the range `[0, n-1]` (inclusive). This means the entire array is passed to `mergeSort`.

2. Inside `mergeSort`, the array is recursively divided into smaller halves until it reaches subarrays of size 1 or 0.

3. The `merge` method is called during the merge step of the sorting process. The elements are compared and merged in a sorted order.

4. Since the array is passed by reference, the changes made to the array within the `mergeSort` and `merge` methods directly affect the original array `arr` in the `main` method.

5. After the `mergeSort` method completes its execution, the `arr` array is sorted. The following `for` loop in the `main` method prints the sorted array:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
}
```

So, even though `mergeSort` is declared as `void`, it modifies the original array directly due to the nature of passing arrays by reference in Java. As a result, when you print the array in the `main` method after calling `mergeSort`, you see the sorted version of the array.

### Time Complexity:

#### Worst-Case Time Complexity:
The worst-case time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n). This occurs when the array is repeatedly divided into two halves until each subarray contains only one element, and then merging takes place. The log n term accounts for the number of recursive calls, and the n term accounts for the work done during each merge.

#### Best-Case Time Complexity:
The best-case time complexity of merge sort is also O(n log n). Even if the array is partially sorted, the algorithm will still divide and merge the subarrays, leading to the same time complexity.

#### Average-Case Time Complexity:
The average-case time complexity is O(n log n). Merge sort's performance is consistent and reliable, making it a good choice for general-purpose sorting algorithms.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n). This is because it requires additional space for the temporary array used during the merging process. In the `merge` method, an ArrayList named `temp` is used to store the merged elements before copying them back to the original array. The space required for this temporary storage is proportional to the size of the input array.

In terms of space complexity, this additional storage makes merge sort less memory-efficient compared to some other sorting algorithms, like quicksort. However, the advantage of merge sort lies in its consistent and predictable performance, as well as its stability (maintains the relative order of equal elements).

To summarize:
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
