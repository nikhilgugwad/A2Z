Let's go through the code and the example in more depth, step by step:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    static void insertion_sort(int[] arr, int i, int n) {
        // Base Case: i == n.
        if (i == n) return;

        int j = i;
        while (j > 0 && arr[j - 1] > arr[j]) {
            int temp = arr[j - 1];
            arr[j - 1] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
            j--;
        }

        insertion_sort(arr, i + 1, n);

    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9};
        int n = arr.length;
        System.out.println("Before Using insertion Sort: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        insertion_sort(arr, 0, n);
        System.out.println("After insertion sort: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

Now, let's break down the code and explain it in detail:

1. **insertion_sort Function:**
   - This function implements the insertion sort algorithm recursively.
   - It takes three parameters: the array to be sorted (`arr`), the current index (`i`), and the length of the array (`n`).
   - The base case checks if `i` has reached the end of the array (`i == n`), and if so, it returns, stopping the recursion.

2. **Main Function:**
   - The `main` function initializes an array `arr` with values `{13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9}`.
   - It prints the array before sorting.

3. **Before Sorting:**
   - The initial array is: `[13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9]`.

4. **Recursive Sorting Process:**
   - The `insertion_sort` function is called with `i = 0` and sorts the array recursively.
   - The recursive calls are made for each index (`i`) until the base case is reached.

5. **Recursive Call Details:**
   - The recursive calls are made as follows:
     - Call 1: `insertion_sort(arr, 0, n)`
     - Call 2: `insertion_sort(arr, 1, n)`
     - Call 3: `insertion_sort(arr, 2, n)`
     - ...
     - Call 6: `insertion_sort(arr, 5, n)`

6. **Sorting Process:**
   - The sorting process involves comparing and swapping elements as needed to ensure the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - Swaps are made within the `while` loop until the element at index `j` is in its correct sorted position.

7. **After Sorting:**
   - Once the recursive calls are complete, the array is printed again.
   - The sorted array is: `[9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52]`.

8. **Final Result:**
   - The array has been sorted using the insertion sort algorithm recursively.

In summary, the recursive insertion sort algorithm works by sorting small portions of the array in each recursive call until the entire array is sorted. The key step is to compare and swap elements to maintain the sorted order.

Let's go through all the recursive calls:

```java
insertion_sort(arr, 0, n);
```

1. **Call 1: insertion_sort(arr, 0, 6)**
   - `i = 0`: The function is called with the original array `[13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9]`.
   - No swaps are needed for `i = 0` as the first element is in its correct place.
   - Recursively, the function is called with `i = 1`.

2. **Call 2: insertion_sort(arr, 1, 6)**
   - `i = 1`: The function is called with the array `[13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9]`.
   - The while loop is not executed for `j = 1` because `arr[0]` (13) is not greater than `arr[1]` (46).
   - Recursively, the function is called with `i = 2`.

3. **Call 3: insertion_sort(arr, 2, 6)**
   - `i = 2`: The function is called with the array `[13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9]`.
   - The while loop is executed for `j = 2` because `arr[1]` (46) is greater than `arr[2]` (24).
   - A swap is performed, resulting in the array `[13, 24, 46, 52, 20, 9]`.
   - Recursively, the function is called with `i = 3`.

4. **Call 4: insertion_sort(arr, 3, 6)**
   - `i = 3`: The function is called with the array `[13, 24, 46, 52, 20, 9]`.
   - No swaps are needed for `i = 3` as the third element is in its correct place.
   - Recursively, the function is called with `i = 4`.

5. **Call 5: insertion_sort(arr, 4, 6)**
   - `i = 4`: The function is called with the array `[13, 24, 46, 52, 20, 9]`.
   - The while loop is executed for `j = 4` because `arr[3]` (52) is greater than `arr[4]` (20).
   - A swap is performed, resulting in the array `[13, 24, 46, 20, 52, 9]`.
   - Recursively, the function is called with `i = 5`.

6. **Call 6: insertion_sort(arr, 5, 6)**
   - `i = 5`: The function is called with the array `[13, 24, 46, 20, 52, 9]`.
   - The while loop is executed for `j = 5` because `arr[4]` (52) is greater than `arr[5]` (9).
   - A swap is performed, resulting in the array `[13, 24, 46, 20, 9, 52]`.
   - Recursively, the function is called with `i = 6`.

7. **Call 7: insertion_sort(arr, 6, 6)**
   - `i = 6`: The base case is reached (`i == n`), so this call returns without making further recursive calls.

After these recursive calls, the final sorted array is `[9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52]`. I hope this provides a clear and accurate explanation. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask.

Let's discuss the time and space complexity of the recursive insertion sort algorithm.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the recursive insertion sort is determined by the number of comparisons and swaps made during the sorting process. The algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) and an average-case time complexity of O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of elements in the array.

In the worst case, when the input array is in reverse order, each element has to be compared and potentially swapped with every previous element, leading to the quadratic time complexity. The best-case time complexity occurs when the array is already sorted, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n).

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the recursive insertion sort is determined by the depth of the recursion stack. In the worst case, the recursion stack can go as deep as 'n', where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. Therefore, the worst-case space complexity is O(n).

It's important to note that insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require additional memory for auxiliary data structures. The space used is primarily for the recursive calls and the function call stack.

In summary:
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) (worst-case and average-case), O(n) (best-case)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
