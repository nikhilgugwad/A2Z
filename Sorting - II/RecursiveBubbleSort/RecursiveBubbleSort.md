The Java code that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm using recursion. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **`bubble_sort` method:**
    ```java
    static void bubble_sort(int[] arr, int n) {
        // Base case: range == 1.
        if (n == 1) return;
        for (int j = 0; j <= n - 2; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                arr[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }

        // Range reduced after recursion:
        bubble_sort(arr, n - 1);
    }
    ```
    - This method takes an array of integers (`arr`) and the current range size (`n`) as parameters.
    - The base case checks if the range is 1. If so, it returns immediately, as an array of one element is already sorted.
    - The method then iterates through the array using a `for` loop.
        - The loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order (ascending order in this case).
    - After the loop, it recursively calls itself with the reduced range (`n - 1`), ensuring that the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position in each recursion.

2. **`main` method:**
    ```java
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int arr[] = {13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9};
        int n = arr.length;
        System.out.println("Before Using Bubble Sort: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        bubble_sort(arr, n);

        System.out.println("After Bubble Sort: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
    ```
    - The `main` method initializes an array of integers (`arr`) and its length (`n`).
    - It prints the original array before sorting.
    - It then calls the `bubble_sort` method to sort the array using the recursive bubble sort.
    - Finally, it prints the sorted array.

In summary, the code demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm implemented using recursion. The `bubble_sort` method recursively sorts the array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements until the entire array is sorted. The `main` method initializes an array, sorts it using the recursive bubble sort, and displays the sorted array.

Let's walk through the provided Java code with an example to understand the recursive bubble sort step by step.

Consider the input array: `[13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9]`.

**Step 1: Initial State**
```
Before Using Bubble Sort: 
13 46 24 52 20 9
```

**Step 2: Recursive Call 1**
- The `bubble_sort` method is called with the array `[13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9]` and `n = 6`.
- The base case is not satisfied (`n != 1`), so it enters the loop.

```
Iteration 1:
  Compare 13 and 46 -> No swap
  Compare 46 and 24 -> Swap: [13, 24, 46, 52, 20, 9]
  Compare 46 and 52 -> No swap
  Compare 52 and 20 -> Swap: [13, 24, 46, 20, 52, 9]
  Compare 52 and 9  -> Swap: [13, 24, 46, 20, 9, 52]
```

- The largest element (52) has moved to the end.
- Recursively call `bubble_sort` with the reduced range (`n - 1`).

**Step 3: Recursive Call 2**
- The `bubble_sort` method is called again with the array `[13, 24, 46, 20, 9, 52]` and `n = 5`.
- It enters the loop again.

```
Iteration 2:
  Compare 13 and 24 -> No swap
  Compare 24 and 46 -> No swap
  Compare 46 and 20 -> Swap: [13, 24, 20, 46, 9, 52]
  Compare 46 and 9  -> Swap: [13, 24, 20, 9, 46, 52]
```

- The second largest element (46) has moved to its correct position.
- Recursively call `bubble_sort` with the further reduced range (`n - 1`).

**Step 4: Recursive Call 3**
- The `bubble_sort` method is called with the array `[13, 24, 20, 9, 46, 52]` and `n = 4`.
- It enters the loop again.

```
Iteration 3:
  Compare 13 and 24 -> No swap
  Compare 24 and 20 -> Swap: [13, 20, 24, 9, 46, 52]
  Compare 24 and 9  -> Swap: [13, 20, 9, 24, 46, 52]
```

- The third largest element (24) has moved to its correct position.
- Recursively call `bubble_sort` with the further reduced range (`n - 1`).

**Step 5: Recursive Call 4**
- The `bubble_sort` method is called with the array `[13, 20, 9, 24, 46, 52]` and `n = 3`.
- It enters the loop again.

```
Iteration 4:
  Compare 13 and 20 -> No swap
  Compare 20 and 9  -> Swap: [13, 9, 20, 24, 46, 52]
```

- The fourth largest element (20) has moved to its correct position.
- Recursively call `bubble_sort` with the further reduced range (`n - 1`).

**Step 6: Recursive Call 5**
- The `bubble_sort` method is called with the array `[13, 9, 20, 24, 46, 52]` and `n = 2`.
- It enters the loop again.

```
Iteration 5:
  Compare 13 and 9 -> Swap: [9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52]
```

- The fifth largest element (13) has moved to its correct position.
- Recursively call `bubble_sort` with the further reduced range (`n - 1`).

**Step 7: Recursive Call 6**
- The `bubble_sort` method is called with the array `[9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52]` and `n = 1`.
- The base case is satisfied (`n == 1`), so it returns without further recursion.

**Step 8: Final State**
```
After Bubble Sort: 
9 13 20 24 46 52
```

The array is now sorted in ascending order using recursive bubble sort. Each recursive call focuses on moving the largest unsorted element to its correct position until the entire array is sorted.

Let's go through the first recursive call (Recursive Call 1) more carefully:

**Step 2: Recursive Call 1**
- The `bubble_sort` method is called with the array `[13, 46, 24, 52, 20, 9]` and `n = 6`.
- It enters the loop.

```
Iteration 1:
  Compare 13 and 46 -> No swap
  Compare 46 and 24 -> Swap: [13, 24, 46, 52, 20, 9]
  Compare 46 and 52 -> No swap
  Compare 52 and 20 -> Swap: [13, 24, 46, 20, 52, 9]
  Compare 52 and 9  -> Swap: [13, 24, 46, 20, 9, 52]
```

In the first iteration of the loop, the `j` pointer starts at the beginning of the array (position 0) and compares adjacent elements. Here's how the comparisons and swaps occur:

1. **Comparison of 13 and 46:** No swap because 13 is smaller than 46.
2. **Comparison of 46 and 24:** Swap because 46 is greater than 24. The array becomes `[13, 24, 46, 52, 20, 9]`.
3. **Comparison of 46 and 52:** No swap because 46 is smaller than 52.
4. **Comparison of 52 and 20:** Swap because 52 is greater than 20. The array becomes `[13, 24, 46, 20, 52, 9]`.
5. **Comparison of 52 and 9:** Swap because 52 is greater than 9. The array becomes `[13, 24, 46, 20, 9, 52]`.

At the end of the first iteration, the largest unsorted element (52) has moved to the last position.

I hope this clarifies how the `j` pointer is moving and comparisons are being made in the first recursive call.

Let's discuss the time and space complexity of the recursive bubble sort algorithm.

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - In the worst-case scenario, where the array is in reverse order, the algorithm may need to make multiple passes to move the largest unsorted element to its correct position.
   - For each pass, the algorithm compares and swaps adjacent elements until the largest unsorted element reaches the end of the array.
   - The number of passes required is equal to the number of elements in the array (`n`).
   - Therefore, the time complexity of recursive bubble sort is O(n^2).

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - Bubble sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't use additional memory proportional to the input size.
   - The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for a few variables (e.g., `temp`, `j`).
   - The space required is independent of the input size.

It's worth noting that recursive implementations of bubble sort, like the one presented here, do not improve the time complexity. They might provide a clearer understanding of the algorithm but do not offer any practical advantages over the iterative version.

In practice, more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort are often preferred over bubble sort for larger datasets due to their better average-case time complexity.
