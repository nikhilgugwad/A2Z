Let's summarize the comparison of the three provided Java programs:

1. **BruteForce:**

   - Time Complexity: O(n^3)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

2. **Better (Improved Brute Force):**

   - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

3. **Optimal (HashMap Approach):**
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)

**Comparison:**

- The **Optimal (HashMap Approach)** is significantly better than both the **BruteForce** and **Better** approaches in terms of time complexity.
- The **BruteForce** and **Better** approaches have cubic and quadratic time complexities, respectively, making them less efficient.
- The **Optimal (HashMap Approach)** has a higher space complexity due to the use of a HashMap, but it offers a substantial improvement in time complexity.

**Conclusion:**

- If you are looking for the most efficient solution in terms of both time and space complexity, the **Optimal (HashMap Approach)** is the recommended choice.
- If you prioritize simplicity and have a small input size, the **Better (Improved Brute Force)** approach might be acceptable.
- The **BruteForce** approach is the least efficient and is not recommended for larger inputs.

Therefore, the **Optimal (HashMap Approach)** is generally the better choice unless specific constraints or considerations suggest otherwise.
