Time and space complexities for the use case of `Arrays.sort()` and the recursive approach:

1. **Arrays.sort() Approach:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
     - The time complexity of the sorting step is O(n log n) using typical sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or TimSort.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
     - The sorting is usually performed in-place, so the space complexity is constant, O(1).

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - If using a divide-and-conquer algorithm like Merge Sort.
     - The time complexity is determined by the recursive calls and any additional operations within each call.
     - Common recursive sorting algorithms like Merge Sort have a time complexity of O(n log n).
   - **Space Complexity:** O(log n) - Stack space for recursive calls.
     - The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion stack.
     - For a binary recursive algorithm (like Merge Sort), the maximum depth is log n.

It's important to note that the time complexity analysis depends on the specific implementation details of the recursive function. The above analysis assumes a standard divide-and-conquer algorithm like Merge Sort. Other recursive algorithms may have different time and space complexities.

When choosing an approach, consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and simplicity of implementation based on your specific use case and requirements.
