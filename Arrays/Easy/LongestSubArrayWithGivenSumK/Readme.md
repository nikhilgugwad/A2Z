Let's compare the four solutions and discuss their performance:

1. **Solution1: Brute Force with Triple Nested Loops**

   - Time Complexity: O(n^3)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

2. **Solution2: Brute Force with Double Nested Loops**

   - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

3. **Solution3: HashMap Approach**

   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)

4. **Solution4: Sliding Window Approach**
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

### Comparison:

- **Time Complexity:**

  - Solutions 3 and 4 have significantly better time complexity (linear) compared to Solutions 1 and 2 (quadratic and cubic, respectively).
  - Solution 4 and Solution 3 both have linear time complexity, but Solution 4 might have a smaller constant factor in practice due to fewer hash computations.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - Solutions 1 and 2 use constant space (O(1)), but they have higher time complexities.
  - Solutions 3 and 4 use extra space, but the space complexity is more favorable in Solution 4 (O(1) vs. O(n)).

### Recommendation:

- **Best Overall Performance:**

  - **Solution4 (Sliding Window):** It has linear time complexity, constant space complexity, and is likely to perform better for large input sizes.

- **Efficient and Practical:**
  - **Solution3 (HashMap):** It has linear time complexity but uses extra space. However, it might be a good choice if the input size is not prohibitively large, and the constant factor in space is acceptable.

In summary, Solution4 (Sliding Window) is recommended for its balance between time and space efficiency. However, the choice might depend on specific requirements, input sizes, and trade-offs between time and space complexities. Always consider the practical implications and constraints of your specific use case.
