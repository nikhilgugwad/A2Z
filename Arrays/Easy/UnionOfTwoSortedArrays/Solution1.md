Let's break down the code and understand each part:

1. **FindUnion Function:**

   - The function takes two sorted arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) and their sizes (`n` and `m`) as input.
   - It uses a `HashMap` named `freq` to store the frequency of each element in the union of the two arrays.
   - It iterates through both arrays, updating the frequency in the `freq` HashMap.
   - After processing both arrays, it adds the unique elements (keys of the `freq` HashMap) to the `Union` ArrayList.

2. **Main Method:**

   - Example usage of the `FindUnion` function with two example arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`).
   - It prints the union of the arrays to the console.

3. **Example Arrays:**

   - `arr1`: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
   - `arr2`: {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 11, 12}

4. **Result:**
   - The union of `arr1` and `arr2` is computed using the `FindUnion` function and stored in the `Union` ArrayList.
   - The result is printed to the console.

In this code, the use of a `HashMap` ensures that the elements in the union are unique, and their frequencies are counted. The `ArrayList` is then used to store and return the unique elements (union) of the two arrays.

Let's break down the following code snippet in more depth:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    freq.put(arr1[i], freq.getOrDefault(arr1[i], 0) + 1);
```

This code snippet is part of a loop that iterates over each element of the array `arr1`. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **`for` Loop:**

   - `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`: This is a standard for loop that starts with `i` initialized to 0, continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the array `arr1` (`n`), and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

2. **`freq.put(arr1[i], freq.getOrDefault(arr1[i], 0) + 1);`:**

   - `arr1[i]`: Accesses the element at index `i` in the array `arr1`.
   - `freq.getOrDefault(arr1[i], 0)`: Retrieves the current frequency of the element `arr1[i]` from the `freq` HashMap. If the element is not present in the HashMap, it returns the default value `0`.
   - `freq.getOrDefault(arr1[i], 0) + 1`: Increments the retrieved frequency by 1. If the element is not present, it starts with a frequency of 1.
   - `freq.put(arr1[i], ... )`: Updates the `freq` HashMap by putting the element `arr1[i]` as the key and the new frequency (after incrementing) as the value.

3. **Explanation:**

   - The purpose of this loop is to count the frequency of each unique element in the array `arr1` and store it in the `freq` HashMap.
   - If the element is already present in the `freq` HashMap, its frequency is incremented.
   - If the element is not present, it is added to the `freq` HashMap with an initial frequency of 1.
   - After the loop completes, the `freq` HashMap contains the frequencies of all unique elements in the array `arr1`.

4. **HashMap Working:**
   - A `HashMap` is a data structure that stores key-value pairs.
   - In this case, the keys are the unique elements from `arr1`, and the values are their frequencies.
   - The `put` method is used to add or update a key-value pair in the HashMap.
   - The `getOrDefault` method is used to retrieve the current value associated with a key. If the key is not present, it returns a default value (in this case, 0).

In summary, this loop processes each element in the array `arr1` and updates the frequency count of each unique element in the `freq` HashMap. This is a common pattern for building frequency maps or counting occurrences of elements in a collection.

Let's break down the following code snippet:

```java
for (int it : freq.keySet())
    Union.add(it);
```

This loop iterates over the keys of the `freq` HashMap and adds each key to the `Union` ArrayList. Let's go through it step by step:

1. **`for (int it : freq.keySet())`:**

   - `freq.keySet()`: Returns a set view of the keys contained in the `freq` HashMap.
   - `for (int it : ...)`: This is an enhanced for loop that iterates over each element of the set of keys. Here, `it` represents the current key in each iteration.

2. **`Union.add(it);`:**

   - `Union`: This is an ArrayList that will store the unique elements (keys) from the `freq` HashMap.
   - `add(it)`: Adds the current key (`it`) to the `Union` ArrayList.

3. **Explanation:**

   - The purpose of this loop is to extract all unique elements (keys) from the `freq` HashMap and add them to the `Union` ArrayList.
   - Since the keys of a HashMap are unique, this operation effectively adds all unique elements from both arrays (`arr1` and `arr2`) to the `Union` ArrayList.
   - The order in which elements are added to `Union` is not guaranteed to be the same as the order in which they were inserted into the `freq` HashMap. HashMaps do not guarantee any specific order of iteration.

4. **HashMap Working:**
   - In a HashMap, `keySet()` returns a set of keys, which can be iterated over using a loop.
   - In this case, the keys are the unique elements from both arrays, as the HashMap was built by counting their frequencies in the earlier loop.
   - Each key is added to the `Union` ArrayList.

In summary, this loop extracts all unique elements from the `freq` HashMap and adds them to the `Union` ArrayList. It's a way to obtain the union of elements from both arrays while ensuring uniqueness.

The output for key-value pairs in the `freq` HashMap, as well as the union of `arr1` and `arr2`, would be as follows:

```
Union of arr1 and arr2 is: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
Key-Value pairs in the freq HashMap:
Key: 1, Value: 1
Key: 2, Value: 2
Key: 3, Value: 2
Key: 4, Value: 3
Key: 5, Value: 2
Key: 6, Value: 1
Key: 7, Value: 1
Key: 8, Value: 1
Key: 9, Value: 1
Key: 10, Value: 1
Key: 11, Value: 1
Key: 12, Value: 1
```

This output shows the union of `arr1` and `arr2`, followed by the key-value pairs in the `freq` HashMap. The keys are the unique elements from both arrays, and the values represent their frequencies in the union.

In the `freq.put()` method, the first argument is the key, and the second argument is the value.

Regarding the behavior when putting a value again for an existing key:

- If the specified key is already present in the `freq` HashMap, calling `put` with the same key will update the associated value with the new value provided. It will not add a new key-value pair; instead, it will replace the existing value associated with the key.

- It will not skip the iteration or throw an exception; it will simply update the value for the existing key.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant line from the code:

```java
freq.put(arr1[i], freq.getOrDefault(arr1[i], 0) + 1);
```

- `arr1[i]` is the key (element from the array).
- `freq.getOrDefault(arr1[i], 0) + 1` is the value. If the key is already present, it retrieves the current value and increments it by 1. If the key is not present, it uses the default value of 0 and increments it by 1.

This approach ensures that the code correctly counts the frequency of each unique element in the array, regardless of whether the element has been encountered before. The HashMap will automatically handle the update of values for existing keys.
