Let's analyze the time and space complexities of each solution:

### Solution1:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m) - Two loops to iterate over both arrays.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m) - The space used by the frequency HashMap.

### Solution2:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m) - Two loops to iterate over both arrays.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m) - The space used by the HashSet.

### Solution3:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m) - Single pass through both arrays with two pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** O(max(n, m)) - The space used by the union ArrayList.

### Comparison:

- All three solutions have the same time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays.
- Solution1 and Solution2 use additional space for the HashMap or HashSet, resulting in O(n + m) space complexity.
- Solution3, with its use of an ArrayList, requires space proportional to the maximum of n and m (O(max(n, m))).

### Performance:

- In terms of time complexity, all three solutions perform similarly and are efficient.
- In terms of space complexity, Solution3 has a potential advantage as it uses less additional space when one array is significantly larger than the other.

### Conclusion:

- The choice of which solution is "better" depends on the specific use case and the characteristics of the input arrays. If space efficiency is crucial and one array is expected to be much larger than the other, Solution3 might be a better choice. Otherwise, all three solutions are reasonable and perform efficiently.
