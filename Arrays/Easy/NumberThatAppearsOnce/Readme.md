Let's analyze the time and space complexities of each approach:

### BruteForce Approach:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The outer loop runs in O(n) time.
  - The inner loop also runs in O(n) time in the worst case (when checking for occurrences).
  - So, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(1) because no additional data structures are used.

### BetterApproach1:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Finding the maximum element takes O(n) time.
  - Building the hash array takes O(n) time.
  - The final loop to find the unique number also takes O(n) time.
  - The overall time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(max), where max is the maximum element in the array.

### BetterApproach2:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Building the HashMap takes O(n) time.
  - Iterating through the HashMap takes O(n) time.
  - The overall time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(n) as it uses a HashMap to store the count of each element.

### Optimal Approach:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The loop to perform XOR takes O(n) time.
  - The overall time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space.

### Comparison:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Optimal Approach (XOR) is the most efficient with O(n) time complexity.
  - BetterApproach1 is also O(n) but may have a larger constant factor due to finding the maximum element and maintaining a hash array.
  - BetterApproach2 is O(n) but involves additional overhead due to using a HashMap.
  - BruteForce is the least efficient with O(n^2) time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - Optimal Approach (XOR) is the most efficient with O(1) space complexity.
  - BruteForce is the most memory-efficient with O(1) space complexity.
  - BetterApproach1 and BetterApproach2 both have higher space complexities, with BetterApproach1 having O(max) and BetterApproach2 having O(n) space complexity.

### Conclusion:

The optimal approach using XOR is generally the most efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It's a good choice when optimizing for both time and space. If you need to optimize for space and the values in the array are not too large, BetterApproach1 could be a reasonable choice. BetterApproach2, while efficient in time, has a higher space complexity due to the use of a HashMap. The BruteForce approach is the least efficient and should be avoided for large datasets.
