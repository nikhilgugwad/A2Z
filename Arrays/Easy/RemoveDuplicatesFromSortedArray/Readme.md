Let's analyze the time and space complexities for each approach:

### BruteForce Approach:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the HashSet operations (add and iterate) take O(1) on average.
- Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of unique elements in the array. This is because we use a HashSet to store unique elements.

### Optimal (Two-Pointer) Approach:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We iterate through the array once.
- Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm performs in-place modification of the input array without using any additional data structures.

### Performance Comparison:

- The Optimal (Two-Pointer) Approach is more efficient in terms of space complexity since it uses constant space, whereas the BruteForce approach uses additional space proportional to the number of unique elements.
- In terms of time complexity, both approaches have the same O(n) time complexity, but the Optimal (Two-Pointer) Approach may perform better in practice due to lower constant factors.

### Conclusion:

- The Optimal (Two-Pointer) Approach is generally preferred over the BruteForce approach, especially when memory usage is a concern.
- In this case, the Optimal (Two-Pointer) Approach performs better in terms of both time and space complexities.

It's important to note that the actual performance can depend on various factors, including the size of the input array, the characteristics of the input data, and the specific implementation details of the Java runtime. However, based on the analysis of time and space complexities, the Optimal (Two-Pointer) Approach is likely to be more efficient.
