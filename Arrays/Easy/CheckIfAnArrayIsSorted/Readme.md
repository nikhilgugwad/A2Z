Let's compare the time and space complexities of the provided programs:

### BruteForce Program:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - The nested loops iterate through all pairs of elements.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space, as no additional space is used based on the input size.

### Optimal Program:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - It iterates through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space, as no additional space is used based on the input size.

In terms of both time and space complexity, the Optimal program is more efficient than the BruteForce program. The Optimal program has linear time complexity, making it more scalable and suitable for larger input sizes.

So, the Optimal program performs better than the BruteForce program in terms of both time and space complexities.
