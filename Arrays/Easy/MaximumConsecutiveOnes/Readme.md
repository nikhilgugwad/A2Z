Let's analyze the time and space complexity of our code:

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of your code is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because you iterate through the array once in the `consecutive_ones` function, and in each iteration, you perform constant time operations. The `Math.max` function also takes constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of your code is O(1), which is constant. The reason for this is that the amount of additional space used by your algorithm remains constant regardless of the size of the input array. The only variables used in your code are `count` and `maxCount`, and they don't depend on the size of the input array. No additional data structures are used that would grow with the input size.

In summary:

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
