Let's analyze the time and space complexities of each program:

1. **BruteForce:**

   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) (due to sorting)
   - Space Complexity: O(1) (no additional space used except for a few variables)

2. **Better:**

   - Time Complexity: O(n) (two passes through the array)
   - Space Complexity: O(1) (only a few variables are used)

3. **Optimal:**
   - Time Complexity: O(n) (single pass through the array)
   - Space Complexity: O(1) (only a few variables are used)

In terms of time complexity, both the "Better" and "Optimal" solutions are more efficient than the "BruteForce" solution. The "Optimal" solution, which performs a single pass through the array, is particularly efficient.

In terms of space complexity, all three solutions are quite similar, as they use a constant amount of additional space (O(1)).

Therefore, the "Optimal" solution is generally the most efficient in terms of both time and space complexity among the three provided solutions. It performs well by finding the second smallest and second largest elements in a single pass through the array.
