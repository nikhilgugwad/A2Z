Let's discuss and compare the time and space complexities of the three programs you provided:

1. **BruteForce:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(N^2)
     - The nested loop checks each element against every other element in the array.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
     - Constant space is used, as no additional data structures are created.

2. **Better (Hashing):**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(N)
     - Two loops iterate over the array once, and the hash table is then checked.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(N)
     - A hash table of size N+1 is used.

3. **Optimal1 (Sum of Natural Numbers):**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(N)
     - A single loop iterates over the array to calculate the sum.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
     - Constant space is used, as no additional data structures are created.

4. **Optimal2 (Bitwise XOR):**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(N)
     - A single loop iterates over the array to perform XOR operations.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1)
     - Constant space is used, as no additional data structures are created.

**Performance Comparison:**

- **Time Complexity:**
  - BruteForce has the worst time complexity at O(N^2).
  - The Better (Hashing), Optimal1, and Optimal2 solutions have more efficient O(N) time complexities.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - BruteForce uses constant space (O(1)).
  - The Better (Hashing) solution uses additional space proportional to the array size (O(N)).
  - Optimal1 and Optimal2 use constant space (O(1)).

**Conclusion:**

- Optimal1 (Sum of Natural Numbers) and Optimal2 (Bitwise XOR) are likely to perform better in terms of both time and space complexity compared to the BruteForce and Better (Hashing) solutions.
- Among Optimal1 and Optimal2, the performance might vary based on specific conditions and the characteristics of the input data.
- Optimal2 (Bitwise XOR) has the advantage of using constant space, which could be beneficial in scenarios with memory constraints.

In general, for most practical purposes, the Optimal1 and Optimal2 solutions are preferred due to their better time complexity and, in the case of Optimal2, better space complexity as well.
