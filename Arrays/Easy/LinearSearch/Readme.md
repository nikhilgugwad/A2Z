The time and space complexities of the provided `linear_search` function.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the linear search algorithm is O(n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm may need to iterate through all elements in the array to find the target element. The time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the linear search algorithm is O(1). This is because the algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space regardless of the size of the input array. The only variables used are 'i' (for the loop iteration), 'arr' (the input array), 'n' (the length of the array), 'num' (the target element), and 'index' (the result). These variables use a constant amount of space, and the space required does not increase with the size of the input.

In summary:

- Time Complexity: O(n) (linear with respect to the size of the input array)
- Space Complexity: O(1) (constant space usage)
