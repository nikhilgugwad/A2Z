Let's analyze the time and space complexities of the two programs:

### BruteForce Program:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The program uses two nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space.

### Optimal Program:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The program uses a single loop, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space.

### Comparison:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The Optimal solution (single loop) has a better time complexity than the BruteForce solution (nested loops) for large input arrays. It is more efficient in terms of time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - Both programs have the same space complexity, O(1), as they use a constant amount of extra space.

### Conclusion:

The Optimal solution performs better in terms of time complexity, especially for large input arrays. It achieves a linear time complexity, making it more efficient than the BruteForce solution with a quadratic time complexity. Additionally, both solutions have the same space complexity, so the Optimal solution is preferable in terms of overall efficiency.
