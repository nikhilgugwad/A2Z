Let's analyze the time and space complexities of the three provided sorting algorithms and then compare their performance:

1. **BruteForce:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(N log N) - Due to the use of `Arrays.sort()`.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The built-in sorting method typically uses an in-place sorting algorithm.

2. **Better:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(N) - Two passes through the array (one for counting, one for updating the array).
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space for the three count variables.

3. **Optimal (Dutch National Flag Algorithm):**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(N) - Only a single pass through the array.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space as it only uses a few variables for indices.

**Comparison:**

- **Time Complexity:** The Optimal solution (Dutch National Flag Algorithm) performs better than the BruteForce and Better solutions in terms of time complexity. It has a linear time complexity, while the other two have a higher time complexity due to sorting algorithms.
- **Space Complexity:** All three solutions have constant space complexity, which is good. However, the Better solution involves an additional ArrayList, which might consume more memory compared to the other two.

**Conclusion:**
The Optimal solution (Dutch National Flag Algorithm) is likely the best choice in terms of both time and space complexity. It performs a single pass through the array and uses constant space. The Better solution, while having linear time complexity, involves additional memory usage with an ArrayList.

Note: The actual performance may depend on various factors such as the size of the input array, the specific implementation of the sorting algorithm, and the underlying system. It's always a good practice to analyze performance empirically for specific use cases.
