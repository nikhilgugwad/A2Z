Sure, let's discuss the time and space complexity of the given program:

### Time Complexity Analysis:

- **Traversal:** The program traverses each element of the matrix exactly once during the spiral traversal. This traversal involves visiting each cell in the matrix exactly once.
- **Nested Loops:** There are no nested loops that depend on the size of the input matrix. Instead, there are four loops, each iterating over a portion of the matrix's boundary.
- **Overall:** Since the number of iterations depends on the dimensions of the input matrix (n rows and m columns), the time complexity is O(n \* m).

### Space Complexity Analysis:

- **Output Space:** The program uses an ArrayList `ans` to store the elements of the matrix in spiral order. The space required to store the output is proportional to the number of elements in the matrix, which is O(n \* m).
- **Variables:** The program uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `left`, `top`, `right`, and `bottom`, which are independent of the size of the input matrix.
- **Overall:** The space complexity is dominated by the space required to store the output, which is O(n \* m).

### Summary:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n \* m)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n \* m)

Where:

- n: Number of rows in the matrix
- m: Number of columns in the matrix

This analysis indicates that the time and space complexity of the program both grow linearly with the size of the input matrix.
