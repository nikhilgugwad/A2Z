Let's analyze the time and space complexities of each program:

1. **BruteForce:**

   - Time Complexity: O(N)
     - Two loops, each traversing the array once.
   - Space Complexity: O(N)
     - Additional space required for two ArrayLists (pos and neg).

2. **Optimal:**

   - Time Complexity: O(N)
     - Single loop, traversing the array once.
   - Space Complexity: O(N)
     - Additional space required for the result ArrayList (ans).

3. **Variety2:**
   - Time Complexity: O(N)
     - Two loops, each traversing the array once.
   - Space Complexity: O(N)
     - Additional space required for two ArrayLists (pos and neg).

In terms of time complexity, all three algorithms have linear time complexity, O(N), where N is the size of the input array or ArrayList.

In terms of space complexity, they are also similar, all having O(N) space complexity due to the need for additional data structures like ArrayLists or Arrays to store positive and negative numbers separately.

Comparing the three, the **Optimal** solution seems slightly more concise and cleaner, as it avoids the need for explicitly handling array indices and simplifies the process by using a single result ArrayList. It may perform marginally better in terms of readability and maintenance. However, actual performance differences might be negligible, and the choice could depend on specific requirements and constraints.

Always keep in mind that the "better" performance might depend on the specific context, and it's advisable to consider factors like code readability, ease of maintenance, and adaptability to different scenarios when choosing an algorithm.
