Let's analyze the time and space complexities of each of the provided programs:

1. **BruteForce:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n^3) - This is because there are three nested loops, each running up to the size of the array.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The space used is constant and does not depend on the size of the input.

2. **Better:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - Two nested loops are present, but the third loop from the BruteForce approach is removed.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Similar to the BruteForce approach, the space used is constant and doesn't depend on the size of the input.

3. **Optimal (Kadane's algorithm):**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) - There is a single loop that iterates through the array once.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The space used is constant, regardless of the input size.

4. **FollowUp (Kadane's algorithm):**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Similar to the Optimal approach, there is a single loop that iterates through the array once.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - The space used is constant, and it doesn't depend on the size of the input.

In terms of both time and space complexities, the Optimal and FollowUp approaches perform significantly better than the BruteForce and Better approaches. The Optimal and FollowUp approaches have a linear time complexity, making them more efficient, especially for large input sizes. Additionally, all four approaches have constant space complexity.

Therefore, the Optimal and FollowUp approaches are preferable in terms of performance, with the Optimal approach being slightly more concise and clear in its implementation.
