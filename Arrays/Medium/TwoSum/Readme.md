Let's analyze the time and space complexities of each approach:

1. **BruteForce:**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - Due to the nested loops iterating through all pairs of elements.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space is used for the result array and loop variables.

2. **Better (HashMap):**

   - **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Iterating through the array once, and each lookup/insertion in the HashMap is O(1).
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) - The space used by the HashMap to store elements and their indices.

3. **Optimal (Two Pointers on Sorted Array):**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and then the two-pointer approach takes O(n) time.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space is used for the result array and loop variables. The sorting is usually done in-place.

In terms of time complexity, the "Better" approach using a HashMap is generally more efficient than the "BruteForce" approach, especially for large datasets. The "Optimal" approach has a time complexity comparable to the "Better" approach, but it may have a slightly higher constant factor due to sorting.

In terms of space complexity, the "Better" approach has a higher space complexity due to the HashMap, while both the "BruteForce" and "Optimal" approaches use constant space.

The choice of which approach performs better depends on the specific characteristics of the input data. For smaller datasets, the differences may not be significant, but for larger datasets, the "Better" (HashMap) approach tends to perform well in practice. The "Optimal" approach may be preferred when the input array is already sorted or when the sorted order is not an issue.
