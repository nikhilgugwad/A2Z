Alright, let's discuss the time and space complexities of each approach:

1. **BruteForce Approach**:

   - Time Complexity: \(O(N \times M \times (N+M))\), where \(N\) is the number of rows and \(M\) is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because, for each cell in the matrix, we potentially traverse its entire row and column to mark elements and then again traverse the entire matrix to replace marked elements with zeros.
   - Space Complexity: \(O(1)\) since we're performing operations in place without using any extra space other than the input matrix.

2. **Better Approach**:

   - Time Complexity: \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the number of rows and \(M\) is the number of columns in the matrix. We traverse the entire matrix twice - once to mark rows and columns containing zeros and then again to replace elements with zeros based on the marked rows and columns.
   - Space Complexity: \(O(N + M)\) for the arrays used to track which rows and columns contain zeros.

3. **Optimal Approach**:
   - Time Complexity: \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the number of rows and \(M\) is the number of columns in the matrix. Similar to the Better approach, we traverse the entire matrix twice - first to mark the rows and columns containing zeros and then to replace elements with zeros based on these marks.
   - Space Complexity: \(O(1)\) since we're not using any extra space proportional to the size of the input matrix. We only use two boolean variables to track if the first row or column needs to be set to zero.

Among these approaches:

- The **BruteForce** approach has the worst time complexity due to its nested loops and repetitive traversal of rows and columns.
- The **Better** and **Optimal** approaches have similar time complexities, but the **Optimal** approach shines in terms of space complexity as it uses constant space, unlike the **Better** approach, which requires additional arrays to track rows and columns containing zeros.

So, the **Optimal** approach performs the best in terms of both time and space complexity.
