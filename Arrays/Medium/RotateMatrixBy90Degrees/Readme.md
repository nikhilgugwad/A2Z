Let's analyze the time and space complexities of both Brute Force and Optimal solutions:

### Brute Force Approach:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The nested loops iterate over each element of the input matrix, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - An additional matrix of the same size as the input matrix is created to store the rotated matrix. Thus, the space complexity is O(n^2) as well.

### Optimal Approach:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The algorithm performs two main operations: transpose and reverse. Transposing the matrix takes O(n^2) time, and reversing each row takes O(n^2) time as well. Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The rotation is done in place, meaning no additional space is required apart from a few variables for swapping elements. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1), constant space.

### Comparison:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Both approaches have the same time complexity of O(n^2). However, the constant factors may differ, affecting actual performance.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The Brute Force approach requires additional space for storing the rotated matrix, resulting in O(n^2) space complexity, whereas the Optimal approach performs rotation in place, requiring only O(1) extra space.

### Performance:

- The Optimal approach performs better in terms of space complexity since it uses constant extra space.
- In terms of time complexity, both approaches are similar, but the Optimal approach might have slightly better performance due to fewer operations.

Overall, the Optimal approach is more efficient, especially for larger matrices, due to its better space utilization. However, for very small matrices, the performance difference might be negligible.
