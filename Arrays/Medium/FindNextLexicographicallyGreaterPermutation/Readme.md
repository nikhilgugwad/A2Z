let's compare the time and space complexities of the two provided solutions:

**BruteForce:**

- Time Complexity: O(N! \* N), where N is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm generates all permutations of the array, and for each permutation, it checks if it's the next permutation, which takes O(N) time.
- Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm only requires additional space for the copy of the original array.

**Optimal:**

- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm finds the next permutation in linear time without generating all permutations.
- Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm operates in-place and doesn't require any additional space proportional to the size of the input array.

In terms of performance:

- The BruteForce solution has a factorial time complexity, which means it will perform poorly as the size of the array increases. It generates all permutations, which is unnecessary and inefficient.
- The Optimal solution has a linear time complexity, making it significantly faster, especially for larger arrays. It directly computes the next permutation without generating unnecessary permutations.

Therefore, the Optimal solution performs better in terms of both time and space complexities, especially for larger input arrays.
